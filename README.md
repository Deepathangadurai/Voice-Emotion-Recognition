# Voice-Emotion-Recognition
A Deep Learning-based Voice Emotion Recognition system using the RAVDESS dataset. Extracts MFCC features from audio and classifies emotions (happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.) using a CNN model. Built with Python, Librosa, and TensorFlow, with a Flask web interface for real-time predictions


# Dataset

This project uses the Emotional Speech Audio Dataset (RAVDESS) for voice emotion recognition.

The dataset is large, so it is not included in this repository.

You can download the dataset from Kaggle here:
Emotional Speech Audio Dataset (RAVDESS) on Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/deepathangadurai/voice-emotion-regconition)

After downloading, extract the files into a folder named
Emotional Speech Audio Dataset (RAVDESS) inside the project directory.
